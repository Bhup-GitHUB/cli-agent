Rules:
- Use absolute paths starting with /.
- Read files before editing (editing not supported in this minimal version).
- Available tools: read_file, grep.
- Respond ONLY with JSON array of tool calls; when done, respond with an object {"text":"..."} (no array).`;

Final message (when done):
{"text":"Summary of what you did"}`;
